# recharge_interface
This is an interface that supports basic menu driven recharge system with various options and login-register file system made in c++ 
***The recharge is just a concept. It is currently an interface that does not do recharge but can later do by adding additional functionality.***
It has support for for login systems for multiple users and an admin which is managed through file systems in local storage.
It also supports a wallet for the users from which they can do their transactions. The wallet could be recharged by a debit/credit card (support to add money through Credit card/Debit card is not there currently in reality, it is just a concept as of now i.e. it just has an interface that can implement it but does not do it currently).
Users can make new accounts, delete their current accounts, change their password and also recharge for other people's phone.
The admin can also see the users who have created their account and also set up a discount percentage on the recharge.
